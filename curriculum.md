Day 1
=====
Intro to the course
Linux basics
- navigation: filesystem, home directory, /, .., ls, cd, pwd, mkdir
- file manipulation: cp, mv, rm, *, wget
- ctrl-c, ctrl-d
Install ipython
ipython
- numeric types and operators: int, float, complex; + - * / ** abs()
https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex

PRACTICAL 1: navigating FS, run ipython, evaluate some expressions

- numeric comparison, dangers of equality testing of floats
- math module (https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html)
- more types: boolean, string

PRACTICAL 2: more ipython
Wrap up: what we've covered and what we're covering tomorrow

Day 2
=====
source files: chmod, #!, args
editor
executing a source file
stdout, stdin

PRACTICAL 3: toy python source that takes input from stdin and outputs to stdout

- function definitions and calls
- if, else, elif
- numpy arrays
- looping: over numpy array, with condition/counter
- pytest

PRACTICAL 4: automated test of root finding using bisection method
