\chapter{The Linux command line}

\begin{itemize}
\item Linux offers a command line which allows you to manipulate files, process data, and perform almost any other operation
\item Some commands take options that modify their behaviour.  Options usually start with one hyphen (\shellcmd{-}) or two hyphens (\shellcmd{-{}-}), and appear after the command name.  Options are separated by spaces.
\item Some commands take one or more arguments which often specify the location of a file or directory.  Arguments come after the command and any options, and are also separated by spaces.
\item A typical command with options and arguments might look like this:
\begin{minted}{bash}
$ sort --numeric-sort -r dataSet2013.txt dataSet2014.txt
\end{minted}
\end{itemize}
% Many built-in commands output to the command line, and some also read their input from it

\section{The file system}
\begin{itemize}
\item Linux has a single file system that comprises a tree of directories that contain files
\item The slash symbol (\shellcmd{/}) identifies the root of the tree
\item A pathname identifies a file or directory, which is the path that is taken through the directory tree to reach it
\item The slash symbol is also used to separate the names of files and directories in a pathname
\item An absolute path specifies a location starting from the root of the tree.  Hence, absolute paths always begin with a slash (\shellcmd{/}).
\item The command line remembers your current location in the directory tree, and you can discover its path with the \shellcmd{pwd} command (short for `Print Working Directory')
\item If a path does not start with a \shellcmd{/} then it gives a location that is relative to the current location.  Hence, it is called a `relative path'.
\item Files that belong to the user are stored in a location called the `home' directory which has the path \shellcmd{/home/\shellvar{myusername}}.  This is analagous to `My Documents' on Microsoft Windows.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Directory manipulation}
\begin{itemize}
\item The \shellcmd{ls} command lists the contents of the current directory
\item The \shellcmd{cd} command, short for `Change Directory', changes the current directory to a new location
\item \shellcmd{cd /home/alice/photos/} moves to the \shellcmd{photos} subdirectory in alice's home directory
\item If our current directory is \shellcmd{/home/alice/photos/}, the command \shellcmd{cd 2009/kenya} changes our current directory to \shellcmd{/home/alice/photos/2009/kenya/}
\item To move up a level in the directory tree, we can use the special directory named with two periods (\shellcmd{..})
\item \shellcmd{cd ..} moves up one level to \shellcmd{/home/alice/photos/2009/}
\item And then \shellcmd{cd ../../} moves up another two levels back to alice's home directory, \shellcmd{/home/alice/}
\item Many other commands also accept a pathname.  For example, \shellcmd{ls /home/alice/photos} lists the contents of alice's photos directory.
\item \shellcmd{mkdir -p \shellvar{pathname}} creates a new directory (and will create any directories that don't already exist in the directory tree)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{File manipulation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Copy a file with the command \shellcmd{cp \shellvar{source} \shellvar{destination}}
\item Copy a directory and all of its contents with \shellcmd{cp -r \shellvar{source} \shellvar{destination}} (where the option \shellcmd{-r} specifies recursive copying)
\item To rename a file or directory, use \shellcmd{mv \shellvar{source} \shellvar{destination}}
\item The same command can be used to move a file or directory to another location in the tree.  For example, \shellcmd{mv photos/2009/kenya photos/2010/} moves the \shellcmd{kenya} directory into the \shellcmd{2010} directory.
\item To delete a file, use \shellcmd{rm \shellvar{file}}
\item To delete a directory and all its contents, first decide if you really want to do this.  There is no Recycle Bin to rescue you.  If you really must, use \shellcmd{rm -r -I \shellvar{directory}}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Special keys and finding help}

\begin{itemize}
\item Use \keys{ctrl+c} to abort a command that is currently running
\item Use \keys{ctrl+d} on a blank line when you have finished entering all the input to a command
\item Most commands come with manuals, called `man pages'; if you know the name of the command, \shellcmd{man \shellvar{mycommand}} displays its man page.  Type \keys{q} to return to the command line.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exercise}
\TODO{move around the FS, create some files and directories etc}

Try sorting a list of numbers.  The \shellcmd{sort} command takes its input from the command line and expects each list item on a new line.  Try entering the following
\begin{minted}{bash}
$ sort --numeric-sort
11.4
11.2
-2
4
\end{minted}
Type \keys{\ctrl+d} on an empty line when you have finished entering the list.  The result should be printed to the command line.

If you make a mistake entering the data, you can abort the \shellcmd{sort} command by typing \keys{\ctrl+c}.  Notice that no sorting is performed and nothing is printed to the command line.

\additional

In the previous exercise we used the \shellcmd{-{}-numeric-sort} option to sort items numerically.  The \shellcmd{sort} command has many other options that control the way data is sorted.

Try sorting words in reverse alphabetical order, ignoring upper and lower cases.  To find the appropriate options, take a look at the manual page with \shellcmd{man sort}, and type \keys{q} to get back to the command line prompt.

The output of one command can be used as the input to another using a pipe (\shellcmd{|}).  To remove duplicate items in a list, we can sort them, then remove adjacent lines that are the same.  Try the following command
\begin{minted}{bash}
$ sort | uniq
bob
alice
charlie
bob
charlie
\end{minted}
using \keys{ctrl+d} when you have finished entering the list.
\end{exercise}

\chapter{The Python programming language}

\section{Installing Python}

\TODO{IPython.  quit with ctrl-d}

\section{Numeric data}
\begin{itemize}
\item There are many different types of data in Python including numeric, textual, and boolean (true or false) data types
\item There are three numeric types built into Python
	\begin{description}
	\item[Integer values ($\mathbb{Z}$)]{Examples of integer values are \shellcmd{5} and \shellcmd{-8}.  Unlike some other programming languages, integers in Python have no minimum or maximum value.}
	\item[Real values ($\mathbb{R}$)]{In Python these are called `floating point' numbers, or just `floats'.  Examples of floats are \shellcmd{5.9}, \shellcmd{13.0} and \shellcmd{-2.39e-12} (where \shellcmd{e} means `exponent', so $\text{\shellcmd{-2.39e-12}} = \num{-2.39e-12}$).  Because floats have limited precision, they can only approximate real numbers, and rounding errors often appear when we do arithmetic with floating point values.  We will point out some of the pitfalls in \TODO{xref}.}
	\item[Complex values ($\mathbb{C}$)]{Not covered in this course, but details can be found at \url{https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesnumeric}}
	\end{description}
\item Python provides a variety of numeric operators including addition (\shellcmd{+}), subtraction (\shellcmd{-}), multiplication (\shellcmd{*}), division (\shellcmd{/}) and exponentiation (\shellcmd{**})
\item Values can be combined with operators to form expressions.  Python can evaluate expressions and print the result to the command line.  For example, \shellcmd{3 + 6 * -2} prints \shellcmd{-9}, and \shellcmd{5.3 ** 2.5} prints \shellcmd{64.66803638583747}.
\item Python uses the conventional order of operations such that multiplication has a higher precedence than addition, for example.  To make the expression clearer, or to force a different order of evaluation, you can use parentheses.  For example, \shellcmd{(3 + 6) * -2} prints \shellcmd{-18}.  For full details of operator precedence, see \url{https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#evaluation-order}.
%\item Variables are used to store data.  A variable should be given a name that describes its purpose, such as \shellcmd{bank\_balance}, \shellcmd{user\_name} or \shellcmd{overdrawn}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exercise}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Try evaluating \shellcmd{12345678901234567890 + 1234567890123456789}.  Now try evaluating \shellcmd{12345678901234567890.0 + 12345678901234567890.0}.  Can you explain why the answers differ?  What is the significance of the decimal place?

\item Try evaluating $3 \div 10$.  Do you get the expected answer?  Now try evaluating $1 \div 10 \times 3$.  Can you explain why the answer is different?

\item Try evaluating \shellcmd{10 + 1e17}.  Why is the answer incorrect?  Can you write a different expression that gives the correct result? % 10 + (10 ** 17)
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\section{Boolean logic}
\begin{itemize}
\item Another of Python's data types is the boolean type.  Its two values are \shellcmd{True} and \shellcmd{False}.
\item We can evaluate boolean expressions using the boolean operators \shellcmd{and}, \shellcmd{or} and \shellcmd{not}.  For example, \shellcmd{not True} evaluates to \shellcmd{False}.  \shellcmd{True or False} evaluates to \shellcmd{True}.
\item Numeric expressions can be compared for equality or inequality using one of the following operators

\begin{tabular}{ c @{\hspace{2em}} c}
	\toprule
	Mathematical expression & Python expression \\ \midrule
	$3 = 4$			& \shellcmd{3 == 4} \\
	$3 < 4$			& \shellcmd{3 < 4} \\
	$3 \leq 4$		& \shellcmd{3 <= 4} \\
	$3 > 4$			& \shellcmd{3 > 4} \\
	$3 \geq 4$		& \shellcmd{3 >= 4} \\
	$3 \neq 4$		& \shellcmd{3 != 4} \\
	\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

All of these expressions will evaluate to a boolean value of either \shellcmd{True} or \shellcmd{False}.

\item We can construct more elaborate expressions.  For example, $3 < 4 \leq 5$ could be written in Python as \shellcmd{3 < 4 and 4 <= 5} or, more consisely, \shellcmd{3 < 4 <= 5}.

\item Because floats are only approximations, it is dangerous to test that they are equal (\shellcmd{==}) or not equal (\shellcmd{!=}).  When working with floating point numbers, you should almost always compare them for inequality (\shellcmd{<}, \shellcmd{<=}, \shellcmd{>}, \shellcmd{>=}).  
\end{itemize}

\section{Mathematical functions}
\begin{itemize}
\item The features we have covered so far are all built into the Python language itself.  Additional functions are provided by Python modules.  The standard Python implementation includes modules for common tasks including mathematical calculations, and reading and writing files.  Additional modules can be installed for more specialised tasks such as matrix solving and graph plotting.
\item The \shellcmd{math} module provides a variety of common mathematical functions.  To gain access to these functions, you must `import' them from the module using the Python command
\begin{minted}{python}
from math import *
\end{minted}
\item The \shellcmd{math} module is documented at \url{https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html}.  Some of the most common functions are summarised below

\begin{tabular}{ c @{\hspace{2em}} c}
	\toprule
	Mathematical function	& Python function \\ \midrule
	$\lfloor 3.3 \rfloor$	& \shellcmd{floor(3.3)} \\
	$\lceil 3.3 \rceil$	& \shellcmd{ceil(3.3)} \\
	$e^{3.3}$		& \shellcmd{exp(3.3)} \\
	$\ln(3.3)$		& \shellcmd{log(3.3)} \\
	$\log(3.3)$		& \shellcmd{log10(3.3)} \\
	$\sqrt{3.3}$		& \shellcmd{sqrt(3.3)} \\
	\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\item The \shellcmd{math} module also includes trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, and also defines the constants $e$ and $\pi$.  For example, we could use them in expressions such as \shellcmd{e ** (-1/3)} or \shellcmd{sin(pi/2)}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Textual data}
\begin{itemize}
\item Python has a data type for textual data.  This type is called a `string' because it comprises a string of characters.
\item A string is enclosed in single or double quotes.  Examples of string values are \shellcmd{'hello world'} and \shellcmd{"The quick brown fox"}.
\item You can include placeholders in a string and use the \shellcmd{format} function to replace them with actual values.  For example
\begin{minted}{python}
"The area of a circle with radius {r} is {area}" \
  .format(r=3, area=pi*3**2)
\end{minted}

Which will print
\begin{verbatim}
The area of a circle with radius 3 is 28.274333882308138
\end{verbatim}
Notice that, because the line was quite long, we have used a backslash so that we can continue the code on a second line.

\item If we want to control how values are formatted when they are printed as text, we can use a `format specifier'.  For example, if we want to display the area with 4 significant digits, we can use the format specifier \shellcmd{.4g} and write
\begin{minted}{python}
"The area of a circle with radius {r} is {area:.4g}" \
  .format(r=3, area=pi*3**2)
\end{minted}

Which will print
\begin{verbatim}The area of a circle with radius 3 is 28.27\end{verbatim}

\item There are many more ways to format data, for more information see \url{https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec}.
